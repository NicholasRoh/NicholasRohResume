        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Information Systems</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> I am currently a second year major at UCR concentrating in Information Systems. I am brand new to coding and so far I really
        enjoy it. I am currently looking for a job or an internship that is concentrated in information systems or data analytics. Past employeers have
        described me as hard working, punctional, and always nice to be around. A little about me, I was born and raised in California; however in 7th grade 
        I had the opportunity to move to the other side of the world on a little island called Guam. Moving helped me become more well rounded by teaching me 
        to appreciate and adjust to new cultures. I took all these skills with me to UCR because we have a very diverse campus.<pr></pr>
        
        In highschool, I was president for the club,STEMpowerment, for 4 years. This was my first leadership experience because I had to manage
        around 50 volunteers a year while also establishing a strong connection with the Boys and Girls Club. My club's mission was to teach kids, 
        ages K-8th grade, cool and challenging science, technology, and engineering experiments. A big challenge I had was finding a reliable 
        group of volunteers who would show up every week. I overcame this problem by setting up a schedule with the Boys and Girls Club staff. 
        This made everyone follow the schedule given to them by the Boys and Girls Club to acquire their hours.<pr></pr>
        
        My very first work experience was in the restaurant industry being a cashier and chef at Souplantation. As a cashier, I learned how to have
        a bright smile everytime a customer walks in while also being focused on giving out the correct amount of change. Where I learned the most is 
        in the back of the house. I learned the importance of correct food temperatures with every item we offered. Food preparation was taken very 
        strictly at Souplantation and I learned how to properly clean, cut, and store each individual item.<pr></pr>
        
        My next real world experience was in the sales industry for a solar company called Momentum Solar, this was my favorite job. I was a Lead Generator
        for 5 hours during the summer. Although it was hot 90% of the time, I learned to take rejection and put on a brand new smile for ever door I visited.
        When I quit the job, I ended as the 3rd best lead generator out of 40 employees. This was a huge accomplishment for me because this was my first experience
        working in the sales industry. This position definitely opened my eyes to potentially look for other jobs in the sale industry.<pr></pr>
        
        All three experiences have taught me to be confident when speaking to customers and always show good customer satisfaction. My job journey has also made 
        me a more rounded person by talking to people from two different industries and learning how each one functions. I am currently looking for a new job or
        internship that will be specific to my business concentration, information systems. <pr></pr>
